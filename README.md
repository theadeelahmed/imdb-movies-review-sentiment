# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. Built using TensorFlow/Keras, this project was developed as part of my learning journey under the guidance of my instructor.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Learn how to preprocess textual data for NLP tasks
- Apply Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras
- Build a binary classification model for real-world sentiment analysis
- Understand model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and loss

## 📚 What I Learned

- Text preprocessing using `Tokenizer`, `pad_sequences`, and vocabulary handling
- How to use embedding layers for NLP
- Designing an ANN architecture for text classification
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Visualizing training progress using accuracy and loss curves

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- NLP techniques

## 📊 Model Summary

- Embedding layer with input dimension = vocabulary size
- Hidden Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with Sigmoid for binary classification

## 📝 Example Output

- Input: _"The movie was a complete masterpiece with stunning visuals!"_
- Output: **Positive**

- Input: _"It was boring and a waste of time."_
- Output: **Negative**

## 🧪 Training Progress

- Achieved good accuracy on test data (~85%+)
- Model shows stability in training vs. validation accuracy
